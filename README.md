## üß† AI Health Analysis Logic

The `healthAnalyzer.js` utility provides intelligent health assessment:

### Risk Score Calculation
- Blood pressure: Up to 25 points
- Heart rate: Up to 15 points
- Blood sugar: Up to 20 points
- Cholesterol: Up to 20 points
- HbA1c: Up to 20 points

### Heart Age Calculation
Factors considered:
- Blood pressure impact: +4-8 years
- Cholesterol impact: +5-10 years
- Blood sugar impact: +3-7 years
- Heart rate impact: +5 years

### Insight Generation
- Automatic detection of health concerns
- Severity-based recommendations
- Evidence-based medical guidance

## üé® Customization

### Customize the Human Body Image

Want to use your own anatomical image? It's easy!

**Quick Method:**
1. Edit `src/components/Body3D.jsx`
2. Change the image URL on line ~100:
   ```javascript
   src="YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE"
   ```

**Or add to project:**
1. Add image to `public/` folder
2. Use: `src="/your-image.png"`

### Changing Theme Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#your-color',
      secondary: '#your-color',
    }
  }
}
```

### Modifying Health Thresholds

Edit `src/utils/healthAnalyzer.js`:

```javascript
if (vitals.bloodPressureSystolic > YOUR_THRESHOLD) {
  // Custom logic
}
```

### Adding New Vitals

1. Add to sample data in `healthAnalyzer.js`
2. Update `VitalsDashboard.jsx` with new card
3. Include in risk calculation logic

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No data storage**: All processing happens client-side
- **No external API calls**: Sample data used for demonstration
- **HIPAA considerations**: For production use, implement:
  - Encrypted data transmission
  - Secure backend API
  - User authentication
  - Audit logging

## üöß Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration with real OCR API (Google Vision, AWS Textract)
- [ ] OpenAI GPT integration for advanced health insights
- [ ] Real-time doctor video consultation
- [ ] Health history tracking & trends
- [ ] Export reports as PDF
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Voice assistant integration
- [ ] Wearable device data sync

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: 3D model not rendering
**Solution**: Ensure WebGL is enabled in your browser and GPU drivers are updated.

### Issue: OCR not extracting data
**Solution**: The OCR uses Tesseract.js which works best with clear, high-contrast images. For production, consider cloud OCR services.

### Issue: Animations lagging
**Solution**: Reduce particle count in `Body3D.jsx` or disable animations on low-end devices.
