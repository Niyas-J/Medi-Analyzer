## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "404: NOT_FOUND"
**Solution**: The deployment URL might be wrong. After deployment:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "medi-analyzer" project
3. Click on it to see the correct deployment URL

### Error: "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND"
**Solution**: This means the deployment doesn't exist yet or was cancelled.
- Start fresh deployment using Method 1 above
- Check your Vercel dashboard for the project status

### Build Fails
**Solution**: Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Common fix: Ensure `dist` folder is not in `.gitignore`
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`

### Image Not Loading (human-body.webp)
**Solution**: Image is already in the repo at `public/human-body.webp`
- Vercel will automatically include it in deployment
- It will be accessible at `/human-body.webp`
